## Human Computer Interaction- Transforming Visual Experiences Using Emotion Recognition
This report examines the factors that initiate emotions both positive and negative in users when
interacting with any interface and explores the effects of these emotions on the cognitive
learning of the users.This report further describes the development
process of the tool EMOLYSIS which was proposed as a solution. This tool help the users to
tag their emotions with different elements of the interfaces to express their feeling about the
design with respect to the colour, font size, and font style of an layout. Moreover, this tool will
provide insights about the interface elements that elicit five different emotions of the user. The
results achieved from this tool will be of practical use to the interface designers.
